My lecture slides are put into two folders.

- The folder "slidesForMyLectureVideos" contains all the slides used to record my lecture vidoes.

- The folder "slidesContinuouslyUpdated" contains the slides that I updated recently.

The slides in the two folders are very similar, but there are some minor changes such as typo correction, contents adjustment, and so on.
